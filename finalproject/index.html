    In Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, on January 19, 1992, Mac Miller was born in the United States. Mac has had a deep interest in music from his early existence.<br>
    Consequently, by age six, he had learned to play the guitar, drums, piano, and bass all by himself. As a musician and a rapper, he was aided by his musical passion and zeal.<br>

O'Connor is known for his pioneering work in a sub-genres of hip-hop referred to as emo rap[3] and trap metal.[2] Since 2010, O'Connor has released an extensive discography and developed a large fan base.
 As of 2019, he has released over 80 albums, mixtapes and EPs across several aliases.<br>
 Elmo Kennedy O'Connor was born in Marin County, California,[4] to a mother who designed clothing and a father who was a web designer.
  His maternal grandfather was actor Robert Culp.[5] His family lived in Muir Beach, California, before moving to New York City. When O'Connor was seven years old, his family moved to Howell, Michigan.

 Despite moving away from his parents at a young age, O'Connor speaks positively of them, stating, "If I tried to write a book about, 'oh, what would be dream parents?', I couldn't even make anything better than them. All they do is shower me in love. Unconditional love, forever."

<h2>Mac Miller</h2>
<p>One of my favorite musicians is Mac Miller, mainly due to a lot of his music being more expensive and moody. I find myself listening to his music a lot, be it while I am studying or just relaxing, I have never had a bad time listening to his music. 
    His music always conveys certain feelings to me that other artists do not convey, and with how many genres of music he is asserted himself in I rarely ever get bored of listening to him. Overall he is one of my favorite musicians and if you have never heard of him or want to hear more of him I would recommend the songs, Eggs aisle, PA nights, and What is the use. </p>

<h2>Kendrick Lamar</h2>
<p>In my opinion, Kendrick Lamar is one of the most creative rappers of his generation. From how he goes about creating his albums to the messages he tries to convey in them, nobody else is able to replicate what he does.
     Additionally, his music is incredible and the lyrics he puts in his songs often have some bigger meaning behind them. Overall, Kendrick Lamar is a rapper who is unique in a field that is full of competition and creates songs that are both enjoyable and meaningful. If you want to hear some of his songs I would recommend Feel, Complexion, and Sing about me, I am dying of thirst.</p>

<h2>BONES</h2>
<p>BONES is a unique case where his primary genre of music is underground rap, something that is fairly niche and certainly not for all tastes. However, one of the primary reasons I like him so much is because he does not stay glued to that format.
While I do enjoy underground rap I feel it is fairly repetitive and I often get burned out on it after listening to it
for a while and I do not get that with BONES. Instead, in addition to his underground rap, he sings some somber and
incredibly insightful songs where he analyses parts of life that seem immoral. If you are interested in looking into him
further I would recommend the songs Numb, TheHealingFields, and IAmCertainlyNotWorthYourTime.</p>
